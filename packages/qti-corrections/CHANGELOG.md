## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#194](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/194) [`db1364a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/db1364adbf2f081f96cde3a9e5511a65c0a17d13) Thanks [@RyanPetersClassroomReady](https://github.com/RyanPetersClassroomReady)! - Reveal the solution after an ended attempt when `show-solution` says so.

  `test-navigation` settles item doneness on an ended attempt and hands it to a new
  `afterAttemptEnded` extension point, alongside the item and its computed-context entry. The hook is
  needed because the computed context only catches up on the next update, after the event has finished
  bubbling.

  `TestNavigationCorrection` overrides it for the standard `qti-item-session-control show-solution`:
  an ended attempt marks the candidate's selection, and a done item also reveals the correct answer.
  The player takes no opinion of its own — whether marks accumulate across attempts belongs to the
  corrections rendering, not to item session control.
