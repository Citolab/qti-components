### Patch Changes

- [#191](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/191) [`3fab714`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/3fab714904293e58e53c0661792f564d84f76bed) Thanks [@RyanPetersClassroomReady](https://github.com/RyanPetersClassroomReady)! - Reject `load()` when the XML fetch fails.

  `qtiTransformTest().load()` and `qtiTransformManifest().load()` wrapped `loadXML` in a `new
Promise` that only ever called `resolve`. When the fetch failed — offline, CORS, a 404 — the
  rejection had no handler, so it escaped as an unhandled rejection and the promise the caller was
  awaiting never settled. A player awaiting `load()` hung there with no error to render and no way
  to retry.

  Both now `await loadXML` directly, so the failure propagates to the caller and an abort still
  surfaces as `AbortError`. Successful loads resolve with the api as before.
