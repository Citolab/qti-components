## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#194](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/194) [`db1364a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/db1364adbf2f081f96cde3a9e5511a65c0a17d13) Thanks [@RyanPetersClassroomReady](https://github.com/RyanPetersClassroomReady)! - Gate linear navigation and further attempts on item doneness.

  An item is done once an attempt has ended and either reached the optimal outcome or exhausted its
  `max-attempts`. `test-navigation` computes that centrally and publishes `done` and `optimal` on the
  computed context.

  Optimality is judged from the scored outcome where there is one — `SCORE` having reached `MAXSCORE`,
  which handles partial-credit and `qti-mapping` items correctly — and otherwise from an exact match
  against the declared `qti-correct-response`. Items with neither (essays, info items) count as done
  after one attempt, since there is no optimal value to require.

  It is latched only when `processResponse` ends an attempt: `qti-assessment-item` now flags that
  context update with `responseProcessed`, so a mid-attempt selection never counts. A restored session
  seeds the latch once from the persisted context.

  `test-next` in linear/individual mode gates on `done` in place of "any attempt ended", and
  `test-end-attempt` is additionally disabled once a non-adaptive item's last ended attempt was
  already optimal — there is nothing left to improve.

## 1.6.5

### Patch Changes

- [`29ed97e`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/29ed97ef79018aa99d941e7d425ac72fa9100abf) Thanks [@Marcelh1983](https://github.com/Marcelh1983)! - Substitute response processing templates in the element's own custom element registry.

  `qti-response-processing` with a `template="…/rptemplates/map_response.xml"` attribute replaces its
  children with the built-in rules for that template. It parsed them with
  `document.createRange().createContextualFragment()`, and the fragment parsing algorithm takes its
  registry from the context node — `document`, so the global registry. In a player rendered into a
  shadow root with a scoped registry whose tags are also defined globally, every substituted rule was
  upgraded with the global class instead of the scoped one, so a registry that overrides a rule (what
  `qti-corrections` does) never saw its own element.

  The rules are now parsed through the element's own `innerHTML`, where the context element is the
  `qti-response-processing` itself and its registry — scoped or global — is the one that upgrades
  them. An unrecognised template name also leaves the authored children in place instead of clearing
  them.
