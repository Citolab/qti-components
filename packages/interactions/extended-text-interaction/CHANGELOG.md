# @qti-components/extended-text-interaction

## 2.0.0-next.6

### Major Changes

- [#347](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/347) [`0f2339a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/0f2339a8f4a24c0c00dc3a8cbe63dd79018703aa) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - A validity message is timed like a native form. Too many shows at once on the change that caused it;
  too few (below `min-choices`, `min-associations`, `min-strings`, or `required`) shows only after a
  submit, the item's end attempt or a form's submit, and from then on every change reports in full. A
  reset forgets the submit. The validity itself is set on every change as before, so a form with a
  below-minimum interaction still does not submit.

  Validity is now also set before the first change and whenever a response is restored or written by a
  host, so an untouched interaction below its minimum makes a form's submit fail (breaking: such a form
  used to submit). Fixed along the way: a choice interaction parsed together with its choices (innerHTML,
  a restored item) lost its `response` attribute; a drag-drop reset left targets that held a chip
  refusing drops.

  Before, dragging a chip into a target and back showed "Please select at least 1 association." at
  once. `reportValidity()` takes an optional `{ trigger: 'change' | 'submit' }` (default `submit`);
  `ValidityKind` and `ValidityTrigger` are exported from `@qti-components/base`.

### Patch Changes

- [#347](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/347) [`0f2339a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/0f2339a8f4a24c0c00dc3a8cbe63dd79018703aa) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - Every interaction that carries a response now works inside a `<form>`.

  - Inline choice, select point and upload write a form value (the chosen identifier; the points as
    `x y,x y`; the file as a base64 data URL). Select point sets validity with `min-choices` /
    `max-choices` and renders `::part(message)`.
  - Graphic associate reads `min-associations` and `max-associations`; the latter defaults to 1, as
    QTI specifies (breaking: an item without the attribute used to accept any number of lines). It
    writes a form value and sets validity. Its points are visible (rings), its lines are black with a
    white outline, a point cannot be paired with itself, "B A" is the existing "A B", each point's
    `match-max` is enforced (`:state(full)`), the chosen start point carries `:state(checked)`, Escape
    or a click on the image cancels a started line, lines have a wide remove target, and points and
    lines are reachable by keyboard.
  - Graphic order validates after the click is applied (it was one click behind).
  - Extended text reports as the candidate types, not only on blur.

### Major Changes

- [#292](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/292) [`8984eab`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/8984eab2eacc6b7d7a9b9454c3c21334cb18dfc3) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - `qti-extended-text-interaction` reads `min-strings`, defaulting to 0 as in the QTI spec. An empty field is now valid unless `min-strings="1"` is set; it used to be invalid. Items that relied on that (e.g. gating next or end-attempt on an answer) must add `min-strings="1"`.
