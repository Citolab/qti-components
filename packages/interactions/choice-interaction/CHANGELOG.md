## 2.0.0-next.5

### Major Changes

- [#347](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/347) [`0f2339a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/0f2339a8f4a24c0c00dc3a8cbe63dd79018703aa) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - One vocabulary for parts and states (qti-theme `CONTRACT.md` §3). Every part is a role and a noun;
  every state is an adjective and a `:state()`; a state on a part is a second token with the state's
  name; verdicts and the answer key have one word each. The old names are still set next to the new
  ones for this major, so nothing breaks until the next one; the theme reads only the new names.

  Renames (old → new):

  - Chips and targets: `:state(drag)` → `:state(chip)`, `::part(drag)` → `::part(chip)`,
    `::part(drag-text)` → `::part(chip text)`, `::part(drags)` → `::part(bank)`,
    `:state(droppable)` → `:state(drop)`, `:state(dragging)` → `:state(lifted)`,
    `:state(placeholder)` → `:state(used)`, `:state(return-anchor)` → `:state(return-target)`.
  - A drag in progress: host `dragzone-active` + `dragzone-enabled` and target `active` + `enabled`
    → `drag-active`; target `hover` → `drag-over`; a full target gets `full` (the `disabled` attribute
    on a target stays for this major). A placed chip exports its handle and text as `chip-control` and
    `chip-label` (`drag-control`, `drag-label` still exported).
  - Keyboard drags now set the same states as pointer drags (`lifted`, `drag-active`, `drag-over`).
  - The bank is `drag-active` (`::part(bank drag-active)`) only while a chip lifted out of a target is
    in flight, when it can take the chip back; a chip lifted out of the bank leaves it unlit.
  - Verdicts: `candidate-partially-correct` → `candidate-partial`; the badge is
    `::part(correction candidate-correct|candidate-incorrect|candidate-partial)` (was
    `correction-correct` …); select-point `::part(point correct)` → `::part(point candidate-correct)`;
    match cells likewise. `:state(incorrect-response)` is gone (never styled).
  - Answer key: `:state(correct-response)` → `:state(answer-key)` (a choice in the key, the full-mode
    clone); `:state(show-correct-response)` → `:state(answer-key-shown)` (the host in internal mode);
    `::part(answer)` → `::part(answer-key)`; `::part(correct-line)` → `::part(line answer-key)`;
    `::part(knob-correct)` → `::part(knob answer-key)`. The theme no longer reads the
    `correct-response` attribute or the `.full-correct-response` class.
  - Other parts: choice `slot` → `choices`; inline-choice `option-selected|option-prompt|option-clear`
    → `option selected|prompt|clear`, `dropdown-icon(-open)` → `icon (open)`; match `c-header`,
    `r-header`, `cols-wrap`, `rows-wrap`, `checkbox-grid`, `input-cell` → `column-header`,
    `row-header`, `columns`, `rows`, `cells`, `cell`; associate `drop-row` → `row`; item-body
    `qti-rubric-blocks` → `rubrics`; graphic order `aria-ordervalue` / `aria-ordercorrectvalue` →
    `data-order` / `data-order-correct`; the sortable preview `data-drop-placeholder` →
    `data-drop-preview`.
  - `@qti-components/base` exports `setState` / `hasState` / `STATE_ALIASES`.

- [#347](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/347) [`0f2339a`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/0f2339a8f4a24c0c00dc3a8cbe63dd79018703aa) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - A validity message is timed like a native form. Too many shows at once on the change that caused it;
  too few (below `min-choices`, `min-associations`, `min-strings`, or `required`) shows only after a
  submit, the item's end attempt or a form's submit, and from then on every change reports in full. A
  reset forgets the submit. The validity itself is set on every change as before, so a form with a
  below-minimum interaction still does not submit.

  Validity is now also set before the first change and whenever a response is restored or written by a
  host, so an untouched interaction below its minimum makes a form's submit fail (breaking: such a form
  used to submit). Fixed along the way: a choice interaction parsed together with its choices (innerHTML,
  a restored item) lost its `response` attribute; a drag-drop reset left targets that held a chip
  refusing drops.

  Before, dragging a chip into a target and back showed "Please select at least 1 association." at
  once. `reportValidity()` takes an optional `{ trigger: 'change' | 'submit' }` (default `submit`);
  `ValidityKind` and `ValidityTrigger` are exported from `@qti-components/base`.

### Minor Changes

- [#329](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/329) [`9c83247`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/9c83247192fb9b0fe073cf21056ab80e6b579ecd) Thanks [@herrKlein](https://github.com/herrKlein)! - Items read more comfortably by default: a taller line height, columns that start level, choices aligned with the prose, and air around inline fields.

  - **Line height.** `qti-item-body` sets `line-height: var(--qti-line-height)`. Browsers and normalize sheets leave it at about 1.15, which put every sentence against the next. The token is derived from the height of an inline field (a field line, plus its block padding and border, about 30px for 16px text), so a line holding a text entry is no taller than the lines around it. Rendered items only: an editor document keeps its own. Re-value `--qti-line-height` to change it, or set it to `normal` to get the old look back. **Items get taller**, from 2% for a short item to about 30% for a matrix or a hottext, so a host that fixes the height of an item box may need more room.
  - **Aligned tops.** A `qti-prompt` no longer carries space above itself, and the first child of a `qti-layout-col*` starts at the column's top edge. Side-by-side columns line up whatever opens them: a heading, a paragraph or an interaction.
  - **Inline elements.** `qti-text-entry-interaction`, `qti-inline-choice-interaction` and `qti-gap` get `var(--qti-inline-gap)` of margin on both sides (a quarter of the spacing unit), so they no longer touch the words around them. Text entry and inline choice also take a block padding of `var(--qti-inline-padding-block)` (a quarter of the spacing unit, not a whole one), so the line holding a field stays close to the height of the lines around it. Both tokens are re-valued on the host or any ancestor.
  - **Choices line up with the text.** A choice with a visible control is pulled out by the room it reserves for its selected paint (`--qti-choice-outdent`, its padding plus its border), so the radio or checkbox sits on the same edge as the paragraphs around it and the selected paint reaches into the gutter. Set `--qti-choice-outdent: 0` for the old indent, or inside a box that clips its content.
  - **Choice spacing.** `qti-choice-interaction` no longer puts a fixed `10px` between its choices: its gap is `--qti-choice-gap`, `0` by default, because each choice's own padding already spaces a list. The theme sets it to the spacing unit for choices drawn as boxes (`qti-input-control-hidden`), where the visible borders need air between them.

  The Kennisnet VRT baselines are regenerated: every item is 8px to 310px taller, and stacked choices sit one padding further left, level with the prompt.
