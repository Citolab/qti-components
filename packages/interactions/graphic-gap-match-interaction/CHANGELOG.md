### Patch Changes

- [#283](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/pull/283) [`4476095`](https://github.com/Citolab/qti-components/commit/4476095f7cb1939ce780980f3a7a3317fc86c5c0) Thanks [@Marcelh1983](https://github.com/Marcelh1983)! - Make `qti-graphic-gap-match-interaction` fit its container, with its drop areas scaling along — as `qti-hotspot-interaction` already does.

  **The graphic overflowed, and its drop areas could not follow it.** An item declares the graphic at the size its `coords` were authored in — often a full-resolution picture, `width="1600"`. The interaction rendered it at exactly that size, so in a two-column layout or on a phone it ran far past its column. Capping the picture alone would not have helped: the drop areas were written as pixel offsets (`left: 79px`), so a narrower picture would have left them on the wrong part of it.

  The drop areas are now placed with `positionShapes`, the helper the hotspot interaction uses: percentages of the graphic's declared size, inside a slot that is exactly the graphic's box. The graphic takes `max-width: 100%; height: auto` and keeps the aspect ratio its width/height attributes declare (pinned as `aspect-ratio`, because an `<object>` derives none from its attributes and an `<img>` defers to its bitmap's). It never upscales. `ellipse` and `poly` drop areas, which the pixel code skipped, are positioned too.

  The theme restates the fluid sizing for the graphic (a direct child of the interaction), because `reset.css` gives every picture inside an interaction `max-width: none`, which outranks the component's `::slotted()` rule. A draggable's own picture is untouched and keeps the same size in the bank and in its drop area.

  With `qti-choices-left` / `qti-choices-right` the image slot is now capped at 75% instead of forced to it, so it stays the graphic's box.

  Not covered: a drop area still grows to fit the largest draggable (`--qti-dropzone-min-*`), so on a heavily scaled graphic a small drop area can be larger than its authored shape. `qti-hotspot-interaction` has the same `reset.css` override issue and is left for a separate change.
