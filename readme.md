@citolab/qti-components is a web component library that can be used to render 1EdTech QTI items.
It's highly customizable and can be integrated in almost every web application.

## Installation

Use npm to install the package:

```shell
npm install @citolab/qti-components
```

## Usage

To use @citolab/qti-components, you need to register the web components and import the required CSS file. By registering the web components, the browser knows how to display the item and create a fully functional item.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
import * as QTI from 'https://unpkg.com/@citolab/qti-components@latest/dist/index.js';
```

```css
@import 'https://unpkg.com/@citolab/qti-components@latest/dist/index.css';
```

```html
<qti-assessment-item identifier="choice" title="Unattended Luggage" adaptive="false" time-dependent="false">
  <qti-response-declaration identifier="RESPONSE" cardinality="single" base-type="identifier">
    <qti-correct-response>
      <qti-value>ChoiceA</qti-value>
    </qti-correct-response>
  </qti-response-declaration>
  <qti-outcome-declaration identifier="SCORE" cardinality="single" base-type="float">
    <qti-default-value>
      <qti-value>0</qti-value>
    </qti-default-value>
  </qti-outcome-declaration>
  <qti-item-body>
    <p>Look at the text in the picture.</p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/sign.png" alt="NEVER LEAVE LUGGAGE UNATTENDED" />
    </p>
    <qti-choice-interaction response-identifier="RESPONSE" shuffle="false" max-choices="1">
      <qti-prompt>What does it say?</qti-prompt>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="ChoiceA">You must stay with your luggage at all times.</qti-simple-choice>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="ChoiceB">Do not let someone else look after your luggage.</qti-simple-choice>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="ChoiceC">Remember your luggage when you leave.</qti-simple-choice>
    </qti-choice-interaction>
  </qti-item-body>
  <qti-response-processing template="https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/qti/v3p0/rptemplates/match_correct.xml" />
</qti-assessment-item>
```
