# QTI-Item

`<qti-item> | QtiItem`

The `qti-item` webcomponent can load and render a single `<qti-assessment-item>...</qti-assessment-item>`.

This can be handy when

    - You want to implement a light-weight player.
    - Or to show an item inside an item bank.
    - Or for scoring purposes where you want the qti-item visible to the scorer.

```html
<qti-item item-url=""></qti-item>
```

The items layout, position and functionality is styled within classes of the
[qti-shared-vocabulary](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/qti/v3p0/vocab#:~:text=The%20QTI%20shared%20vocabulary%20is,for%20a%20screen%2Dreader%20candidate)

```xml
<qti-assessment-item>
  <qti-item-body>
    <p>Look at the text in the picture.</p>
    <p><img src="images/sign.png" alt="NEVER LEAVE LUGGAGE UNATTENDED" /></p>
    <qti-choice-interaction max-choices="1" response-identifier="RESPONSE">

      <qti-simple-choice identifier="A">You must stay with your luggage at all times.</qti-simple-choice>
      <qti-simple-choice identifier="B">Do not let someone else look after your luggage.</qti-simple-choice>
