# custom element manifest

This project includes a [custom element manifest](./custom-elements.json) that describes the custom elements used in the project.
This manifest is generated automatically during the build process and provides metadata about the custom elements, such as their properties, methods, events, and slots.
The manifest is useful for documentation, tooling, and IDE support, as it allows developers to understand how to use the custom elements effectively.
The `custom-elements.json` file is located in the root directory of the project.

It is exported through the `package.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "./customElements": "./custom-elements.json"
  }
}
```

then you can import it in your project like this:

```js
import manifest from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@citolab/qti-components@latest/custom-elements.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

if you use the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wc-toolkit.web-components-language-server extension in VSCode,

`wc.config.js` can be configured like this to use the manifest for better autocompletion and documentation:

```javascript
export default {
  libraries: {
    '@citolab/qti-components': {
      manifestSrc: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@citolab/qti-components@latest/custom-elements.json'
    }
  }
};
```
