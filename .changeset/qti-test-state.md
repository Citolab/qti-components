Add `qtiTest.state` and the `qti-state-changed` event: one value to persist and restore a candidate's test session (item variables, per-interaction state, test outcomes, position) without declaration metadata or the answer key. The state can be assigned before the test loads and is applied before the first item does. Also restores per-interaction state (e.g. a PCI's `getState()`) into an item when it loads, and makes `navigate="section"` start at the restored section.
